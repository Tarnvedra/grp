          <hr>
          <p> I am a published portrait photographer who has always been drawn to people. I am now forging a career as a hard working professional portrait photographer whilst directing a motivated and hardworking people-focused brand that reflects high quality imagery and trust with a personal touch within commercial photography.</p>

 <p> My photographic career to date has mainly been people intensive, working with many different people from many different backgrounds. I have worked on a national advertising campaign providing promotional images for a barber shop product supplier. I have also had the honour of photographing His Majesty Prince Charles when he came to Stoke-on-Trent to officially open up a new part of the Middleport Pottery factory as part of the Princesâ€™ Trust regeneration program and I was one of the lucky photographers to be selected. My photography has taken me on journeys to London, Paris and New York and even to Scotland to photograph the hardest working UK Japanese Taiko drumming band.</p>
